======
JOSM Plugin based on photo_geotagging plugin. I will use this plugin to integrate image processing.
Requiers plugin development environment to build it from code. Refer http://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/DevelopersGuide/DevelopingPlugins
Using Plugin:
*.jar file included in repo can be used.
*Import images and corelate them with gpx track. 
*Right Click on Image Layer and select 'Process Image'.
*It will list the imported images.
*Further process will be added.

======
Added class for cascadeDetect and minor UI changes.
Still no image processing can be done as I am yet to successfully integrate opencv libs.
